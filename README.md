### Hi there 👋
I'm James Shin, a third year at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. I am passionate about growing as a software developer and building impactful projects!

- 🧑🏻‍🔧 I’m a Full Stack Developer at [Web Dev at Berkeley](https://webatberkeley.org), currently working with the MERN stack to develop a new iteration of the [Clicked](https://clicked.com/) beta, a platform helping people find their true passions by enabling access to hands on experiences.
- 🔭 In my own time:
  - I’m currently working with several other developers to build [Kalenda](https://kalenda.io/), a platform that makes scheduling team meetings more effective
  - I’m also currently building [Spero](https://shopspero.org)'s new website to open a virtual store showcasing Christian-themed merchandise as part of the remote marketing & sales solutions in response to COVID-19
- 🌱 I’m excited about learning new stacks and frameworks:
